ABOUT THE RESEARCH 42

be a source and driver of transformational
change across all industries. The chemical
industry strives to be a frontrunner in managing
digital transformation. We therefore welcome
Accenture’s study on AI and blockchain
technologies and the potential impact
on the chemical industry.
The purpose of the study is to spark ideas
on how the chemical industry can reap
benefits from applying both technologies
in their business models. AI can boost the
industry toward a higher level of efficiency.
New data analytics including artificial
intelligence, machine learning, and deep
learning are expected to impact all business
processes as they will efficiently extract
the value from data.
Where AI will reinvent the nature of our work,
blockchain will impact how we interact across
the value chain. Through blockchain, chemical
companies can increase the transparency
into how products are processed in each step
down the value chain—allowing companies to
tailor production to customers and proving the
authenticity and circularity of their products.
3
Combined, both technologies present major
opportunities for our chemical industry to
contribute to long-term European policy goals,
such as substantially increasing resource
or energy efficiency and thus reducing
carbon and other environmental footprints.
Value chains as we know them will change
completely: products and related processes
become more personalized, creating and
delivering higher value for customers through
the empowerment of local, more specialized
value chains. The chemical industry will
develop new data-based business models.
Simultaneously, products will increasingly
incorporate digital service components,
enabled by the abundance and growing flow
of data, to strengthen the competitiveness
of the entire offer.
This study provokes new reactions to
new technologies by giving valuable
recommendations to our chemical industry.
Let’s get ready to create a (block)chain reaction.

CeficINTRODUCTION
On the surface, today’s
chemical industry looks solid,
with peak cash and stable
profits. Although some
segments have performed
better than others, in general,
times have been good.
new technologies, building the workforce to
address demographic change and contending
with ever-increasing regulatory requirements.
Chemical companies have long relied on
advancing technology to address challenges,
from the robots and microprocessors of the
1960s through the sensors, big data tools and
cloud platforms of the last decade. (Figure 1)
Today, the industry’s attention is turning
to two emerging technologies: artificial
intelligence (AI) and blockchain. Both have the
potential to help chemical companies achieve
step-change improvements in performance
and value. (Figure 2) These technologies are
likely to have an impact on the value chains
and profit pools within those chains. But they
could also have far-reaching implications for
the structure of the entire industry and how
it operates.
The industry’s offerings continue to enable
businesses around the world to optimize
their performance, create new customer
offerings and drive growth and profitability.
That said, the industry faces challenges
on many fronts—from shifts in feedstock
costs to changes in customer needs and
competitive threats from new entrants.
These challenges are especially significant
in areas such as the customer interface,
safe and sustainable operations, integrating

56DISRUPTION OF CHEMICAL
BUSINESS MODELS
THROUGH ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE AND
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY
Chemical companies’ business
models are constructed around
a common set of approximately
40 building blocks.
These support several organizational
dimensions, which typically include product
and service offerings, customer interactions,
the management of assets and the supply
chain and organizational enablers. (Figure 3)

maintenanceAccenture believes that each of the building
blocks will experience disruption from
widespread adoption of AI and/or blockchain
technology. Adoption of these technologies will
fundamentally alter how chemical companies
perform work and interact with customers.
(Figure 4) In the near future, business models
will focus on technology-based offerings,
AI-enabled customer interactions, data-driven
management of assets and the supply chain,
and back-office processes that are automated
as much as possible.
For example, today’s cost-plus or
target-price cost calculations will be
replaced by contextual pricing based
on foresight and market simulations driven
by AI. Primary customer interactions will be
based on virtual support, reducing the need
for customer service centers and enabling
companies to offer customers highly relevant
products and services—and to do so more
frequently. Chemical companies will be better
able to predict process results based on more
detailed specifications of input materials,
or to bring their research and development
(R&D) to new levels through AI-based result
explorations. Logistics will be revolutionized
through tamper-evident, near real-time
tracking and freight settlement functionalities.
And predictive maintenance will reach new
heights through the processing of large
volumes of data and AI-based simulations.
With these technologies, commodity and
specialty chemical companies alike will
experience disruptive change in their business
models. They will have unprecedented visibility
into the end uses of their products and will be
able to operate plants with drastically reduced
levels of lost-time incidents. They will also be
able to offer 24/7 service at zero incremental
cost and to extract insight and value from the
massive amounts of data being generated
continuously. At the same time, human
employees will be able to focus on more
creative tasks throughout the organization—
allowing for more innovation and driving
additional growth.

Today, AI is already a part
of daily life. For example,
it is not at all unusual for
someone to take Uber to the
airport, using the time in the car
to catch up on presorted e-mail
and do some online shopping—
arriving after a productive and
seamless experience.
In the not-too-distant past, that experience
would not have been possible. Today, it is,
because it is largely based on AI technologies.
AI helps the person and the Uber driver to
connect, navigate around traffic jams and find
the best route. It prioritizes e-mail and screens
out fraudulent messages, provides shopping
recommendations, and even offers a selection
of music tailored to the rider’s tastes. And
AI-enabled autonomous vehicles are on the
verge of being approved for widespread
use on public roads—which means that
the car soon may have no driver.
AI is a group of technologies that includes
machine learning, computer vision and
speech recognition, and it is at the core of
tools such as predictive analytics, advanced
process automation, robotics and mechanical
automation, among many others. AI has quickly
become relevant in private life and business-to-
consumer (B2C) contexts, and it will soon have
a tremendous impact on the chemical industry.
AI has the potential to disrupt business
operations by helping companies to:
• Make more informed decisions.
• Make better use of existing data.
• Develop new insights from large amounts
of data that would overwhelm humans.
11
• Accelerate learning.
• Automate repetitive, transactional
and judgment-related tasks.
• Reduce human involvement in physical tasks.
• Create new services and offerings.
Two recent examples show just how far
one type of AI—natural language recognition
and generation—have evolved. In recent years,
a university used IBM technology to create
“Jill Watson,” an AI-based teaching assistant
that replied to students’ e-mails, 2 and the
Google Duplex AI system, which successfully
reserved a restaurant table by phone. 3 In both
cases, the people on the receiving end were
unable to detect that they were conversing
with a robot.
In a business context, AI is used to handle
routine, rules-based and increasingly complex
tasks, such as capital market investment
management, even if there are multiple and
varying factors and sentiments to consider.
AI does this so well that 56 percent of hedge
funds base their investment decisions on AI and
machine learning, and more than a quarter use
AI to execute transactions autonomously. 4

In general, today’s AI technologies can be grouped into three categories categories logistics detailed
